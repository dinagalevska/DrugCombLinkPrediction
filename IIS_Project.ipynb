eligibility criteria in the Master MATCH Protocol             prior to registration to treatment subprotocol          -  Patients must have one of the following missense mutations in DDR2: S768R, I638F,             L239R          -  Patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 8 weeks prior to treatment             assignment and must have no clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction             or morphology of resting ECG (e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree             heart block)          -  Patients with known left ventricular dysfunction must have an echocardiogram (ECHO) or             a nuclear study (multigated acquisition scan [MUGA] or First Pass) within 4 weeks             prior to registration to treatment and must not have left ventricular ejection             fraction (LVEF) < institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). If the LLN is not defined             at a site, the LVEF must be > 50% for the patient to be eligible        Exclusion Criteria:          -  Patients must not have known hypersensitivity to dasatinib or compounds of similar             chemical or biologic composition          -  Patients with prior use of dasatinib will be excluded          -  Dasatinib should NOT be given in the presence of STRONG CYP 3A4 inhibitors/inducers.             Patients who take these drugs concurrently are ineligible for treatment with             dasatinib. These drugs must be discontinued prior to initiation of dasatinib          -  Dasatinib should NOT be given in the presence of H2-antagonists or proton pump             inhibitors. Patients who take these drugs concurrently are ineligible for treatment             with dasatinib. These drugs must be discontinued prior to initiation of dasatinib.             Antacids taken 2 hours before or after dasatinib administration can be used in place             of H2-antagonists or proton pump inhibitors if some acid-reducing therapy is needed\n",

A minimum of four weeks washout             of antidepressant medication should occur prior to screening. Subjects with a prior             history of depression (but not currently depressed) are allowed in the study.          -  Fewer than four years of formal education.          -  A documented history of transient ischemic attacks.          -  Baseline MRI findings or CT-scan findings within a year of screening that are             consistent with a process other than AD, e.g., stroke, tumor, brain trauma or             hydrocephalus, that may contribute to the subject's MCI. Lacunae infarcts present in             areas affecting cognition (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, medial temporal lobe) will             also exclude the subject from the study.          -  A score of greater than 4 on the Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale.          -  A current diagnosis of any primary neurodegenerative disorder, e.g., Parkinson's             disease.          -  A current diagnosis of uncontrolled seizure disorder.          -  A current diagnosis of active peptic ulceration.          -  A current diagnosis of severe and unstable cardiovascular disease.          -  A current diagnosis of sick-sinus syndrome or conduction deficits (sino-atrial block,             second or third degree atrio-ventricular block).          -  A current diagnosis of acute, severe, or unstable asthmatic conditions.          -  A known exaggerated pharmacological sensitivity or hypersensitivity to drugs similar             to Exelon or to other cholinergic compounds (e.g., pilocarpine, bethanechol, tacrine,             velnacrine, donepezil, metrifonate, or physostigmine). Subjects who have experienced             elevations in liver function test parameters on other cholinesterase inhibitors are             still eligible.          -  Taken any of the following substances: An investigational drug during the past four             weeks; Metrifonate during the past three months; a drug or treatment known to cause             major organ system toxicity during the past four weeks; other cholinergic drugs (e.g.,             donepezil, tacrine, succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants) during the past two weeks             (topical pilocarpine will be permitted); antidepressant medication during the past             four weeks.          -  Participated in a previous clinical trial of Exelon.          -  Clinically important laboratory abnormalities in serum B12, folate, or T3/T4 at             screening. The subject should be excluded if peripheral neuropathy, macrocytic anemia,             or myxedema is present.          -  If screen values do not meet the absolutely exclusionary values given below but are             still outside the normal reference range, treatment for folic acid/B12 deficiency or             thyroid disorder, as appropriate, may be initiated or adjusted with re-evaluation of             the subject within three months. Within these three months of treatment, the subject's             cognitive condition must be clinically unchanged or worse for the subject to be             acceptable. Once accepted, the subject must remain on the appropriate treatment             throughout the study.          -  Exclude if T3 uptake is less than 19%; T4 less than 2.9 ((g/dL); free T4 index is less             than 0.8          -  Exclude if folate less than 1.7 ng/ml (normal range greater than 1.9)          -  Exclude if B12 less than 100 pg/ml (normal range greater than 200)          -  A positive rapid plasmin reagin test followed up by a positive serological test for             syphilis.          -  A disability that may prevent the subject from completing all study requirements             (e.g., blindness, deafness, severe language difficulty).  \n",
